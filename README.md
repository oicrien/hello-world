# hello-world
"This is my first day," was an expression used by my previous co-workers. They were from the four corners region, natives specific to the Navajo tribe. I foud the epxression funny and still use it. I remember them asking me to tell them a story often (hours were long and gruelling) I tried my best to entertain them. I suppose it paid off, while the lifestyle of working with them was extremely gruelling, we were all mongrels weathering the cold, I was able to work with them for many months and proved my value. I wonder if I will ever see any of them again. If I pass through the four corners region I will poke around, expose myself to the chance of running into them - this happens more often than one would expect.
